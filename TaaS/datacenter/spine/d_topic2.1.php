    <p class="fs-6"><h5 class="text-warning">What does the Spine Layer in Leaf-Spine Architecture?</h5><br>
    The <i><b class="text-warning">Spine layer</b></i> is the backbone of a Leaf-Spine network topology. It consists of high-performance Layer 3 switches that are responsible for routing traffic between all the Leaf switches. <br>
    <b class="text-info">key characteristics</b>: <br>
    <li>Function: Routing - Spine switches handle the movement of data packets across the network, determining the best path for communication between Leaf switches.</li>
    <li>Connectivity: Full Mesh - Each spine switch is interconnected with every Leaf switch in the network, typically in a full mesh topology. This redundancy ensures multiple paths for data flow and avoids bottlenecks.</li>
    <li>Location: Core - Spine switches reside at the core of the Leaf-Spine architecture, forming the central interconnection point for all network traffic within the Fabric.</li>
    <b class="text-info">Advantages over Traditional Network Architectures</b>: <br>
    <li>Scalability: Easily adding more Leaf switches to accommodate additional devices without impacting performance.</li>
    <li>Low Latency: Minimized travel time for data packets due to the direct connections between Leaf and Spine switches.</li>
    <li>High Availability: Redundant paths in the Spine layer ensure network continuity even if a switch fails</li>
