    <p class="fs-6"><h5 class="text-warning">What does the Leaf Layer in Leaf-Spine Architecture?</h5><br>
    In a Leaf-Spine network topology, the <b class="text-warning">Leaf layer</b> acts as the access layer, directly connecting devices like servers and storage units to the network.. <br>
    <b class="text-info">key characteristics</b>: <br>
    <li>Function: Access and Aggregation - It provides physical connections and Layer 2 forwarding for devices like servers, storage, and potentially other network devices. Leaf switches can also aggregate traffic before sending it to the spine layer.</li>
    <li>Connectivity: Connects to Spines - Each Leaf switch establishes connections to all Spine switches in the network, usually in a full mesh topology. This redundancy ensures multiple paths for data to travel and avoids bottlenecks.</li>
    <li>Devices:  Leaf switches - These are typically high-density access switches with numerous ports to accommodate connections from a large number of devices.</li>
    <li>Scalability: The Leaf layer is easily scalable by adding more Leaf switches as the network grows.</li>
    <li>Convergence: Since Leaf switches connect directly to Spines, data paths are typically shorter, leading to faster convergence times in case of network changes.</li>
